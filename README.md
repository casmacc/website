# CASMACC Website

Containerized Applications for Social Marketing And Customer Communications

This is a Jekyll website mimicking the Minima theme, but using Bootstrap4.

Minima's wrapper is replaced by BootStrap's container, in order to use
Bootstrap's grid system and other features.

To update: clone this repo.  Then:

    > cd docs
    > jekyll help   # see jekyll commands
    > jekyll clean  # remove generated assets
    > jekyll build  # rebuild the website locally
    > jekyll serve  # start local server for development

Note that generated assets are stored in the `_site` directory.

When you push your changes, GitHub pages will automatically update the website.
