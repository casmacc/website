# CASMACC Website

Containerized Applications for Social Marketing And Customer Communications

This is a Jekyll website mimicking the Minima theme, but using Bootstrap4.

Minima's wrapper is replaced by BootStrap's container, in order to use
Bootstrap's grid system and other features.

See the [live website](http://casmacc.github.io/website/) on GitHub pages.
